= AskPeek =

Years ago (2009 era), I used a device called a Peek to access my email on the go. To
assist in making this useful, I put together an application (in PHP) that would check
various websites, repackage extracted information, and return it via email.

A customized version of this was prepared and provided under the AskPeek banner. As I
no longer have need of this, and as it is a drain on my limited server and financial
resources I made the decision to shut it down.
